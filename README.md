# Introduction

MetaGPT is an application that automatically generates python codes based on GPT (as used
in ChatGPT).

While the naive GPT model (as used in ChatGPT) can generate Python codes, the code 
it generates often contains errors. Compared to the ChatGPT, MetaGPT tests the 
generated/managed codes locally and automatically ensures that the code can run 
smoothly and meet certain expectations.

Compared to [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), MetaGPT is more
specialized at generating Python codes. By leveraging metaprogramming, MetaGPT is more
stable and easier to use.

MetaGPT combines metaprogramming (in Python) and large language models (LLMs) (GPT). 
* [Metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) refers to the 
programming method which involves one program (the meta program) writing another program
(the target program).
* [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are recently developed neural 
networks that can generate text based on the context.

Here is a simple illustration about our algorithm:

# Installation and requirements

* Linux-based system (tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.02)
* Python 3.7.1 or higher. We recommend using a new virtual environment 
(e.g., [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html))
```
conda create -n mg python=3.10
```
```
conda activate mg
```
* This repository
```
git clone https://github.com/JLX0/MetaGPT.git
```
```
cd MetaGPT
```
* The OpenAI Python library (tested with 0.27.6)
```
pip install openai
```

* OpenAI API key with GPT-3.5 and/or GPT 4 access. You can get one from
[here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

# Usage

## In general

Before using MetaGPT, please make sure that you have met the general requirements
as specified in *Installation and requirements*.

You can run the following command to check the configuration information of 
MetaGPT:
```
python3 mg.py -h
```

The file *mg.py* requires at least three arguments: -o, -f, and -k. 
* The argument *-o* describes the objective of this code
* The argument *-f* describes the path to the python file what is supposed to be read 
and written by MetaGPT
* The argument *-k* describes the openAPI key you want to use

Please be careful about using a notebook format file (such as .ipynb) in *-f*, 
as GPT might try to execute linux commands in the notebook.

If you want to use the *-e* argument (in order to create code beyond the built-in packages in Python)
, it would be safer to download the required packages in the environment beforehand.

## Example 1: Generate a Python code of a genetic algorithm

The expected input of the algorithm (argumments of the func
tion) include the size
of the population and the maximum number of generations
```
python3 mg.py -o "create a genetic algorithm" -f "ga.py" -k "aa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" -in "1.population_size: the size of the population, 2.max_generation: the number of generations the algorithm create" -out "the fitness of the best individual" -e "1.numpy"
```
Please replace the key *"aa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"* with your
own OpenAPI key. The generated code is saved in your current working directory as a file named 
*ga.py*. Sample codes generated by this command can be found in the folder *samples* (*ga_1.py* and 
*ga_2.py*)

The above commands assume that in your current environment, numpy is installed. 
If not, please use the following command instead:
```
python3 mg.py -o "create a genetic algorithm" -f "ga.py" -k "aa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" -in "1.population_size: the size of the population, 2.max_generation: the number of generations the algorithm create" -out "the fitness of the best individual"
```
